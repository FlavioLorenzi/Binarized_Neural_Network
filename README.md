NB: yet to implement   (   work in progress   )

Binarized Neural Network on three types of datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN.
Tensorflow framework and Python_3 are required.
For each dataset we will implement: 1)A standard deep nn (ReLu non linearity) with original batch normalizzation and vanilla Adam optimizer; 2)A binarized nn (Sign function) with original batch normalizzation and vanilla Adam optimizer; 3)Another binarized nn (Sign function) but with shift based batch normalizzation and shift based Adam optimizer.
