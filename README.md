Binarized Neural Network on three types of datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN.
Tensorflow framework and Python_3 are required.
For each dataset we will implement: 1)A binarized neural network (Sign function) with original batch normalizzation 2)A binarized neural network (Sign function) but with shift based batch normalizzation.
The default optimizer is the Vanilla Adam, but in according with the above paper we improve the network with a particular extension optimization, the Shift Based AdaMax. In the end it's possible to plot some graphs about accuracy and loss of the trained network.
