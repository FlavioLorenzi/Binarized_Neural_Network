Binarized Neural Network on three types of datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, SVHN.
Tensorflow framework and Python_3 are required.
For each dataset we will implement: 1)A binarized neural network (Sign function) with original batch normalizzation and vanilla Adam optimizer; 2)A binarized neural network (Sign function) but with shift based batch normalizzation and shift based Adam optimizer.
