Binarized Neural Network on three types of datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10

Tensorflow framework and Python_3 are required.

For each dataset we will implement: 
  1) A binarized neural network with original batch normalizzation 
  2) A binarized neural network but with shift based batch normalizzation.

The default optimizer is the Vanilla Adam, but according with the above paper we improve the network with a particular extension optimization, the Shift Based AdaMax. 

In the end it's possible to plot graphics about accuracy and loss of the trained network.
